# Guess-the-number
This represents an uncomplicated yet captivating Python project suitable for novices. Within this undertaking, we'll devise a Python program. Within the program, the computer will autonomously select a random number from a range, in my example, it's 0 to 100. Subsequently, the user will be furnished with a clue to conjecture the chosen number. Upon each incorrect attempt by the user, additional hints will be supplied, progressively guiding them to the correct solution. These hints may indicate whether the actual number is smaller or larger. The user's task is to deduce the number within a maximum of 10 tries to avoid losing the game.
